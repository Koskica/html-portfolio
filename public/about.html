<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, My name is Dusan, my nickname is Koska. Im looking to get into Web Development because I find it very interesting.</p>

<p>I used to study a little bit of programming in highschool where we did QuickBasic and C++. After that I took a break from programming for some time
  and now I feel I need to get back into it.
</p>

<p>Preferably I would focus more on Web Design, but you could never tell where the water might
  flow at the end. I hope this enthusiasm will stuck with me for a long long time.
